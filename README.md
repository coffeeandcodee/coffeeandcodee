Hi, I’m Ahmed Idris, an aspiring developer with a (typical) fondness for coffee. 
I’m interested in full stack development, artificial intelligence & data science, and right now I'm learning C++.
I’m looking to collaborate on any interesting projects, especially those pertaining the medical sector or improving education.
You can reach me via email at a9idris@gmail.com
