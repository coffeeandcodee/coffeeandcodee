Hi, I’m Ahmed Idris, a .NET developer and aspiring ML researcher with a fondness for caffeinated beverages.

I’m interested in full stack development and artificial intelligence.

I’m looking to collaborate on any interesting projects, especially those pertaining the medical sector or improving education. 

A recent endeavour of mine is designing a new programming language for improved ML utilities. Check out my "cognito" repo for more details.

You can reach me via email at a9idris@gmail.com. Check the Tech211, HotelListingAPI, and MCVTrackerApp repositories for an idea of my skillset.
